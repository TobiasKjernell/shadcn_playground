Shadcn is based on Radix UI. Radix comes with the html and logic, they are completely naked from CSS. Shadcn writes CSS into them.
If you going to use a component from Shadcn, you will have to install them into the project, one by one. 
Instead of importing everything, you save up alot by just using the one you need.
It will create a 'component/ui/your-shacn-componen.tsx'

CLI command: npx shadcn add <component>

Shadcn using Lucide icons as default.

uses oklch as color standard    

in 'lib/utils', shadcn generates a function called 'cn'. cn stands for className and will make your life easier when trying to render
some classes based on conditional. 

EXAMPLE: <button className={cn('bg-color-red','text-sm', isPending ? 'text-orange-50' : 'text-green-50')}>

asChild prop on dropdowns lets us use Buttons inside another button component. it kinda replaces it.

Darkmode needs to be installed from: npm install next-themes

Charts is based on Recharts plugin.
